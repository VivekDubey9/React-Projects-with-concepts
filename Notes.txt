React is javascript library blah blah....
It can be injected into html using cdn links 
Now react will come as global object ,type React in console can play with them...
React is just a piece of javascript code

------------------------------------------------------
React is built for diff purposes not only for browser like for mobile devices (React Native)
react 3d and react for rendering purposes... core of react library...
             VS
ReactDom is for browser itself.... reactDom is Dom accessed using this... responsible for all DOM operations


--------------------------------------------------------------

React.createElement("h1",{},"hello world!"); react element returns an object....



----------------------------
functional component---just a javascript function which returns jsx
Name of fn compo always starts with CAPITAL letter. (just a convention)
if in a single line then () not necessary <div><h1>hello</h1></div>

but if in multi line it is mandatory to use ()
also can omit the return statement...



functional component are executed via two ways- <FComponent /> like html tag 
                                                {Fcomponent()} normal fn call
also you can use react element using curly braces {}
any piece of javascript code you can execute inside curly braces...

const header = () => {

return (
    <div>
    {any react element or any piece of js code}
    <h1>Hello World! </h1>
    </div>
);

also can return react element after all jsx is React.createElement();
}


you can run your own script just modify script:
npx parcel index.html
"start":"parcel index.html"
